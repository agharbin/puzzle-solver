# puzzle-solver

A short python program to find a Hamiltonian path through the degree-4 graph defined in edges.txt.  The first line in the file determines the starting node, and the second line determines the goal node.  The remaining lines are a list of vertices with the adjacent nodes on its up, down, left and right edges.
